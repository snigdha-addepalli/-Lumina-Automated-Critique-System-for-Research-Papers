However, there are some areas that could be improved to enhance the clarity and conciseness of the text. 1. The use of abbreviations (e.g., OCR, CNN, SymPy) without prior definition could be problematic, particularly for non-specialist readers. It is essential to provide brief definitions or context for these abbreviations to ensure the reader understands the terminology. 2. The sentence structure could be improved to create a more natural flow. For example, the sentence \"By combining computer vision, convolutional neural networks, and symbolic computation, the system improves efficiency and accuracy in interpreting mathematical expressions\" could be rephrased for better clarity. 3. The paragraph could benefit from a more concise and focused description of the system's architecture.

The paragraph is well-organized, with clear transitions between ideas, and the author effectively uses specific examples to illustrate the complexity of the problem. However, there are some areas for improvement. The paragraph is quite long, with several sentences that could be consolidated or rephrased for better clarity. For instance, the sentence \"Mathematical notations involve a diverse set of symbols, from basic operators to specialized functions and Greek letters\" could be rephrased to \"Mathematical expressions include a variety of symbols, including basic operators, specialized functions, and Greek letters\" or \"Symbolic notation is characterized by a range of symbols, including basic operators, specialized functions, and Greek letters.\" This would make the paragraph more concise and easier to follow.

Without this information, the reader is left in the dark about the purpose and significance of the provided table.
